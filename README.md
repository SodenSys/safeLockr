safeLockr is a simple web API for encrypting and decrypting a single string of input. It does so by a combination of Caesar-cipher and randomization.

##### How to encrypt:

- Navigate to http://safelockrapi-env.eba-d2idsiid.eu-north-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/encrypt?plainText= in your browser of choice (preferably Firefox, because it's the best!).
- At the end of the URL, after "plainText=", simply enter the input you want to encrypt and press 'Enter' to receive your encrypted output.

##### How to decrypt:

- Similarly, navigate to http://safelockrapi-env.eba-d2idsiid.eu-north-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/decrypt?encryptedText= in your browser of choice.
- At the end of the URL, after "encryptedText=", simply enter the input you want to decrypt and press 'Enter' to receive your decrypted output.
